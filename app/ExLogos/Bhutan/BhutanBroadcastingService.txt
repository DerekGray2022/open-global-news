The BBS Radio was started by a group of young western educated university graduates on November 11, 1973. They borrowed a 400 watt civil wireless transmitter and went on air. Initially the broadcast was available only on Sundays and only for half an hour. The language was English. The group called themselves the National Youth Association of Bhutan and the radio station, named after them, was known as Radio NYAB. A year later, they extended the airtime, adding another half an hour in the national language Dzongkha.
