Simon Vratsian played a major role in the establishment of the agency. After the Sovietization of Armenia in 1920 it was renamed to Armenkavrosta, and subsequently known as Armenrosta and Armenta. It was renamed Armenpress in 1972. During the Soviet period, from 1920 to 1991, it served as the 'official sanctioned source of public information', operating under direct control of the Armenian Communist Party. https://armenpress.am/eng/"
