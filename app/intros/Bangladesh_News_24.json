        "body": "bdnews24.com is an English and Bengali language news portal of Bangladesh. In 2005, the company launched initially as the country's first exclusively web-based news agency, and was known as BDNEWS. The website bdnews24.com developed by Ahmed Yasir Riad (2005-2013) was Bangladesh's first 24/7 bilingual news web portal. The other two national news agencies at the time were the state-owned Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) and the privately owned United News of Bangladesh (UNB), which at the time were teleprinter-based 'wire services'. Following a take-over in mid-2006 at the agency's holding company Bangladesh News 24 Hours Ltd, ownership is vested between two sole board directors: Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief Toufique Imrose Khalidi, and Chair of the company Asif Mahmood."
